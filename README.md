## Important Notice
Versions 1.4 and 1.4.1 have been deleted due to a critical dependency error. Please forgive me and update to version 1.4.4

## About

This is an Android library to parse a RSS Feed. You can retrive the following information about an article:
<ul>
<li> Title
<li> Author
<li> Description
<li> Content
<li> Main Image
<li> Link
<li> Publication Date
<li> Categories
</ul>

**Disclaimer**: This library has been built starting from RSS feed generated from a Wordpress Site. Of course it's compatible with RSS feed generated from other tipe of sites; [Here](https://www.androidauthority.com/feed/) you can find an example of RSS feed.

## How to
#### Import:
The library is uploaded in jCenter, so you can easily add the dependency:
```Gradle
dependencies {
  compile 'com.prof.rssparser:rssparser:1.4.4'
}
```
#### Use:
```Java
import com.prof.rssparser.Article;
import com.prof.rssparser.Parser;

//url of RSS feed
String urlString = "http://www.androidcentral.com/feed";
Parser parser = new Parser();
parser.execute(urlString);
parser.onFinish(new Parser.OnTaskCompleted() {
    
    @Override
    public void onTaskCompleted(ArrayList<Article> list) {
      //what to do when the parsing is done
      //the Array List contains all article's data. For example you can use it for your adapter. 
    }

    @Override
    public void onError() {
      //what to do in case of error
    }
});
```
## Sample app
I wrote a simple app that shows articles from Android Authority. If in the article's content there isn't a image, a placeholder will be load.
